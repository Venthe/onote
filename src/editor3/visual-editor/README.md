# Document

## Typographical structural elements

1. Paragraph: A paragraph is a self-contained unit of text consisting of one or more sentences. It is typically separated from adjacent paragraphs by whitespace and is used to group related ideas or information together. Paragraphs help break up the text, making it easier for readers to follow the flow of content and identify distinct topics within the document.
2. Section: A section is a larger organizational unit within a document that groups together related content. Sections often have headings or titles that indicate the main topic or theme of the content they contain. Sections can be used to create a hierarchical structure within the document, with higher-level sections encompassing broader topics and lower-level sections delving into more specific details.
3. Heading: A heading is a text element that introduces a section of content. Headings are often formatted differently from regular text to make them stand out, such as being larger, bold, or using a different font style. Headings help readers quickly identify different sections and understand the document's organization.
4. Subsection: Similar to a section, a subsection is a subdivision of a larger section. It further breaks down content into more specific topics or categories, maintaining the hierarchical structure of the document.
5. Title: The title is the main name or label of the document. It appears at the beginning and typically provides readers with a clear idea of the document's subject or purpose.
6. Subtitle: A subtitle, if present, follows the title and provides additional context or details about the content.
7. Bullet Points and Numbered Lists: These are used to present information in a concise and organized manner. Bullet points typically list items without a specific order, while numbered lists indicate a sequence or hierarchy.
8. Table of Contents: In longer documents, a table of contents lists all the major sections and subsections, often with corresponding page numbers. This serves as a navigational aid, allowing readers to quickly locate specific content.
9. Footnotes and Endnotes: These are used to provide additional information, explanations, or references without interrupting the main flow of the text. They are often indicated by superscript numbers in the text, with the corresponding notes placed at the bottom of the page (footnotes) or at the end of the document (endnotes).
10. Appendices: Appendices are supplementary sections that contain additional material, such as charts, graphs, tables, or in-depth explanations. They are typically placed at the end of the document.
11. Block Quotes: Used to emphasize and separate quoted or extracted text from the main content, block quotes are typically indented and formatted differently from the surrounding text.
12. Margin Notes: These are brief annotations or comments placed in the margins of the document, providing additional insights or explanations related to specific parts of the content.
13. Epigraphs: An epigraph is a short quotation or phrase at the beginning of a section or chapter, often used to set the tone, introduce themes, or provide context for the content that follows.
14. Pull Quotes: Pull quotes are short excerpts from the main text that are highlighted and placed in a visually distinct manner within the document, drawing attention to key points or engaging statements.
15. Headers and Footers: These are portions of text that appear at the top (header) or bottom (footer) of each page in a document. They often include information like page numbers, chapter titles, dates, or other metadata.
16. Dividers or Horizontal Lines: Used to visually separate different sections or content within a document, horizontal lines or dividers can help break up long stretches of text.
17. Callouts or Sidebars: These are boxes or sections placed alongside the main text, containing additional information, anecdotes, or related content that complements the main content.
18. Drop Caps: A drop cap is a large initial letter at the beginning of a paragraph, often used to signal the start of a new section or to add a decorative element to the text.
19. Indentation and Alignment: Proper indentation and alignment of text can also contribute to the visual structure of a document. First-line indentation, block indentation, and centered alignment are examples of formatting choices that influence the document's appearance and readability.
20. Lists of Figures, Tables, and Illustrations: In technical documents or those with numerous visual elements, separate lists may be included to help readers quickly locate specific figures, tables, or other illustrations.

## Embeds

1. Images: Images are visual representations that can include photographs, illustrations, diagrams, charts, graphs, and more. They are often used to convey information visually, support the text, or enhance the aesthetics of the document. Images can be placed within the content, aligned with text, or presented in a standalone manner. While they contribute to the overall structure and layout of the document, they are not structural elements in the same way that headings and paragraphs are.
2. Attachments: Attachments are external documents, files, or materials that are included with the main document. These can include spreadsheets, presentations, detailed data, extended references, or additional resources that are relevant to the main content but are separate from the document's textual structure. Attachments are often referred to within the text but are not integrated into the main flow of the document's structure.
3. Table: A table is an example of an embed because it is a visual element that is inserted into the document to present data in a structured format. Tables are used to display information such as statistics, comparisons, or relationships between different data points. While tables enhance the document's content and organization, they are not considered primary typographical structural elements like headings or paragraphs.
4. Charts: And image
5. Diagrams: And image
6. Videos, Audio clips: multimedia
7. Code block

## Markup elements

1. Bold Text: Used for emphasis and strong impact.
2. Italic Text: Used for subtle emphasis or to indicate titles.
4. Underlined Text: Used sparingly for special emphasis.
5. Strikethrough Text: Used to indicate deletion or correction.
6. Monospace Text: Used for code or to indicate something that should stand out.
7. Small Caps: Uppercase letters styled as small capitals.
8. Superscript (²): Used for indices and references.
9. Subscript (₃): Used for indices and references.
10. Highlight
11. Color

## Document hierarchy

1. Sections and Subsections: Documents are often divided into sections and subsections, creating a hierarchical structure. Each higher-level section may contain several subsections, and each subsection can be further divided into sub-subsections, and so on. This hierarchy helps break down the content into manageable and coherent units, allowing readers to delve deeper into specific topics.
2. Headings: Different levels of headings are used to mark the hierarchy within sections. Major headings (often labeled as "Chapter" or "Section") represent higher-level divisions, while subheadings represent lower-level subdivisions. The formatting of these headings (e.g., font size, boldness) can also indicate the hierarchical level.
3. Indentation: Indentation is a common way to visually represent hierarchy. Subsections are typically indented to the right under their parent sections, making it easy for readers to identify relationships between different levels.
4. Table of Contents: A table of contents provides an outline of the document's hierarchical structure, listing the major sections and subsections along with their corresponding page numbers. This acts as a navigational aid for readers.
5. Cross-References: Cross-references within the document, such as referring to other sections or subsections, help establish connections and show the hierarchical relationships between different parts of the content.
6. Appendices: Appendices, which contain supplementary material, can also be organized hierarchically. They can have their own sections and subsections, if needed.
